FORT SMITH FUEL CONSUMPTION TRACKER

HOW TO USE THIS WORKBOOK:

1. DOWNLOAD WEATHER DATA
   • Go to: https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html
   • Search for: Fort Smith A (Station ID: 2202201)
   • Select: Daily data
"   • Download: September, October, November 2025"
   • Copy Max Temp and Min Temp columns into the 'Weather Data' sheet

2. RECORD FUEL FILLS
   • Update the 'Fuel Fills' sheet with each delivery
"   • Record: Date, gauge reading before fill, liters added"
   • Record: Price per liter and total cost
   • Total cost will auto-calculate if you enter price/liter

3. VIEW ANALYSIS
   • Check the 'Analysis' sheet for your fuel efficiency (L/HDD)
   • This ratio tells you how much fuel you burn per heating degree day
   • View cost analysis showing total spending and monthly projections
   • Update the estimated price/L (yellow cell) to project future costs

4. PREDICT FUTURE CONSUMPTION
   • Use weather forecasts to estimate HDD
   • Or use the pre-calculated scenarios (mild/normal/deep winter)
   • Enter custom HDD/day in the yellow cell to see predictions

ABOUT HEATING DEGREE DAYS (HDD):

HDD measures how cold it is and how much heating you need.
"Formula: HDD = max(0, 18°C - average daily temperature)"

Examples:
  • If avg temp is -2°C: HDD = 18 - (-2) = 20 HDD
  • If avg temp is 10°C: HDD = 18 - 10 = 8 HDD
  • If avg temp is 20°C: HDD = 0 (no heating needed)

Typical Fort Smith HDD/day:
  • September: 5-8 HDD/day
  • October: 10-15 HDD/day
  • November: 15-20 HDD/day
  • December-February: 20-25+ HDD/day
  • March: 15-20 HDD/day
  • April: 8-12 HDD/day
