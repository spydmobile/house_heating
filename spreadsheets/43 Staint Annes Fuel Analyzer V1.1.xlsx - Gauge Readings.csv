HOW TO USE:,,,,,,,,
1. Record your gauge reading periodically (weekly or whenever you check),,,,,,,,
2. Enter: Date and Gauge % (columns A and B),,,,,,,,
3. Est. Liters auto-calculates: Gauge % × 10 (for 1000L tank),,,,,,,,
4. Other columns calculate consumption since last reading,,,,,,,,
5. HDD Period: manually enter total HDD between readings (from Weather Data sheet),,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:,,,,,,,,
"• Today: Check gauge (e.g., 65%), enter date and 65 in columns A & B",,,,,,,,
"• Next week: Check gauge (e.g., 58%), enter new date and 58",,,,,,,,
"• Sheet calculates: 70L used, 10L/day, and if you enter HDD, it shows L/HDD",,,,,,,,
