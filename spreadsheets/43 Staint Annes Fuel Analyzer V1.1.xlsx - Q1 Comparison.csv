INSTRUCTIONS:,,
1. Wait until April 2026 (after Q1 2026 is complete),,
2. Download Jan-Mar 2026 weather data from Environment Canada,,
3. Record your fuel fills from Jan-Mar 2026,,
4. Calculate Q1 2026 L/HDD efficiency,,
5. Compare to Q1 2025 baseline to measure window impact,,
,,
NOTE: Q1 comparison is ideal because:,,
  • Coldest period = maximum heating demand,,
  • Same seasonal conditions year-over-year,,
  • Window impact will be most measurable in cold weather,,
